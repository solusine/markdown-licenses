# CERN Open Hardware Licence
###### Version 2 - Permissive

### Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on those designs.
Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three variants: this licence, `CERN-OHL-P` (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: `CERN-OHL-W` (weakly reciprocal) and `CERN-OHL-S` (strongly reciprocal).

The `CERN-OHL-P` is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in unmodified form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in their development.

> The Licensor makes no representation that any Source or Product does not or will not infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right.
> The entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not the Licensor.
>
> This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under this Licence.

> [!CAUTION]

> The Licensor shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties, in relation to such use.

### 6. Patents

#### 6.1

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this [section 6](#6-patents), or where terminated by the Licensor for cause) patent licence to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products, where such licence applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as Conveyed by that Licensor.

> [!WARNING]
> #### 6.2
> If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate as of the date such process is initiated.

### 7. General

#### 7.1

If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain effective.

#### 7.2

You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is known, except where needed to comply with [section 3](#3-copying-modifying-and-conveying-covered-source), or where the use is otherwise allowed by law.
      
Any such permitted use shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or its personnel.

#### 7.3

CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
New versions will be published with a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant.

If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that variant.
If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated as being released under `CERN-OHL-S`.

The Licensor may also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the `CERN-OHL` or any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version of `CERN-OHL` with the same variant identifier published by CERN.

#### 7.4

This Licence shall _not_ be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.
