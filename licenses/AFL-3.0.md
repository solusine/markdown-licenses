The term “_Source Code_” means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work.

Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.

If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.

This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in [Section 1](#1-grant-of-copyright-license), including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
